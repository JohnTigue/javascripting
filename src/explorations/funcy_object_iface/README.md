## Funcy object module interfaces

This is a JavaScript module interface "type" which leverages JavaScript's features maximally. It returns an Object which is a Function, with various properties as well.

There are a few files in this directory.
- `funcy-objects.js` simply explores the fundimentals of JavaScript on the topic of Functions versus Objects.
- `funcy-object-module-interface.js` describes what the Funcy Object interface type's goals are. The file is actually a Mocha test script working through the features.
- `example-funcy-object-module.js` is an example of the interface type. This is actually the module used during testing in `funcy-object-module-interface.js`
